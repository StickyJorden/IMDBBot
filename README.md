This is a Discord Bot made in Javascript and C. 

Display the path between two actors given their movies.

Steps to run program:

1. Download console.js file
2. Run using "node console.js" 

This will give the output to the console. 

There is a Javascript front end, but the application Discord is needed to run it. 
See images below of what the javascript front end looks like in Discord.
